    "A siamese network is a network having two identical subnetworks that share parameters. A siamese network gives a *similarity metric* between pairs of inputs, which assigns high values to similar pairs and low values to dissimilar pairs. In MNIST, we can construct similar pairs by taking images from the same digit class, and dissimilar pairs from images from different classes. \n",

    "\n",

Each subnetwork is an MLP with 2 hidden layers with 64 units, followed by a \"distance layer\" with 32 units. They will be created using the **`mlp()`** function you implemented earlier, using input argument `hidden_sizes=[64,64,32]`. The network computes the cosine similarity, as defined above, in the final output layer.\n",
